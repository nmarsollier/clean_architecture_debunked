# Debubkin Clean Architecture on Mobile

SOLID GRASP CUPID

Clean is not OO

Clean if for backend it is old too old it failed on backend it is not going g to be successful on ui

Failed on backend

Android is Reactive Use Cases are not

Use Cases makes complex scenarios worst

Never seen Use Case useful

Interfaces are wrong understood 

Interfaces are only needed with strategy 

Common frameworks libraries etc are not Clean

Too many unuseful layers 

It does not grow 

It can't handle Mobile completely 

Hard to handle cahe strategies
